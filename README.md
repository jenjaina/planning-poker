An app that will allow a software development team to play Planning Poker

==============

Welcome! This app is designed to allow a software development team to play "Planning Poker", a game used to estimate how much time different development tasks will take. To learn more about Planning Poker, check out the article on wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker). The app will run in your browser and allow your team to silently vote on tasks, then reveal the results.


To run this app, clone the repository, open a command line/terminal, and cd into the directory.


Next, start the server by typing:

  npm install
  
then:

  node app.js


Once the server is running, open the app in your browser by navigating to: localhost:1337/poker.html

You can open multiple tabs to see how multiple users can submit their estimations and view the results.


Thanks for viewing!
